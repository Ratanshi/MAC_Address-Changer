# MAC_Address_Changer
Inside every network enabled computer is a Network Interface Card (NIC) which comes with a unique MAC (Media Access Control) address to identify it.
MAC addresses are set by the manufacturer and literally burnt into the card; they can't be changed although they can be spoofed.
This is a program designed to Spoof MAC addresses to prevent identification.
